# TEI Assist
TEI Assist is an open-source tool designed to help users add machine-readable codes to text following standardized TEI guidelines. Currently in development by Dr. Yue Cui for the George Eliot Archive project, this tool enables editors to add tags with a single click, verify codes, and easily correct errors such as duplicates.

Here are the key features: 
1. Automatic Tagging: Paste a document into the editing panel and click the paragraph tag <p>. The tool will automatically wrap the paragraph in <p> tags. (Note: You may need to press command + z to highlight the tags.)
2. Quick Editing Mode: Select any text in the editing panel and wrap it with the selected tag. The selected text will be shown in the “Tagged Elements” section below. 
3. Apply to All: All selected text is recorded in the “Tagged Elements” section with an “Apply to all” button. Clicking this will tag all occurrences of the selected text. If the first action doesn’t show, clicking again will display it. We are working to resolve this inconvenient bug.
4. Tag Verification: Use the “Verify All Tags” button to fix any double tags in your document.
5. Customizable Appearance: Change the font family and size to suit your preferences.

Future Features(under development)
1. Support for additional tags and automatic header generation.
2. AI-assisted tag generation.
3. A "Quick Deleting Mode" to remove tags from selected text.
