# TEI Editor
This open-source TEI tool, currently in development by Yue Cui, allows editors to add tags with one click. Errors can be easily corrected.
See https://georgeeliotarchive.github.io/TEI/editor/

Here are some features: 
1. If you paste a document in the editing panel, and click <p> on the available tags to the left. it will automatically add a <p> tag around the paragraph. Note, you may need to hit command + z to make the tags highlighted. 
2. With the “Quick Editing Mode”, you can easily select any text in the editing panel and wrapped them with the selected tag. The selected text will be shown in the “Tagged Elements” section below. 
3. All the selected text will be recorded in the “Tagged Elements” section with a button “Apply to all”. If you click this button, all the other occurrence of the words will be tagged as well. Sometimes, the first apply to all action will not be shown, but if you click the second one, the first one will be shown at the same time. Again, I don’t know how to fix it yet, but I will keep trying. 
4. There is a “verify all tags” button to the left, and it will fix all the double tags.
5. We can change the font family and size. 

Some future features(under development)
1. Supporting more tags and generating headers for the document.
2. Using AI to generate tags automatically.
3. "Qucik deleting mode" will allow user to select any tagged text and delete all tags for that text.
